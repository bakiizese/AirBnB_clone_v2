It is just a 10 min drive from downtown Phoenix and old town Scottsdale. You’ll love my place because of the location, the coziness, and the amenities provided. The apartment is furnished with a 
simple elegance and is great to relax in after a long day of exploring the valley. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, and business travelers, and anything in between.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It is a spacious 1 bedroom/studio with a minimalist/elegant style.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You will have access to every part of the apt but I do have my personal belongings in the closet across from the bathroom. Please respect my things and this area. The complex itself has laundry onsite which I would 
be willing to help you access for a fee.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;I will be often available after 5pm on weekdays and all day on 
the weekend. I live on the floor below in the same building.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The neighborh</div>
