Please read directions/details and be aware that rain or inclement weather may make travel to/from the ranch more difficult.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;It&#39;s on a working ranch, there are cows and workers! We do not have someone to specifically meet cabin guests, so it is a serve-yourself setup. We are available by phone if needed.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You have the whole cabin to yourself. Feel free to walk around areas around the cabin, and it&#39;s especially lovely to walk down the river bed when it is dry (which is most of the time).&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;You&#39;re on your own, we&#39;ll tell you where the key is...&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;The nearest towns are Dudleyville and Winkelman, several 
miles north of the ranch. The location itself is remote, so it&#39;s best to come prepared if you don&#39;t want to travel to and fro</div>
